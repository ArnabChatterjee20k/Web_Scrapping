How does a website works in the backend?
Step 1: User requests a page. Eg:- www.google.com

Step 2: On whichever server the data is, that server sends you back a raw html file.
Step 3: Web browser converts the html file into a readable webpage

What is web scrapping?
The technique of taking the html file sent by the server into python and scrapping it instead of giving it to the browser and displaying it is called Web scrapping.

Two ways of getting data from a website:

Using API
HTML web scrapping using some tool like bs4

requests will help us to get the content from internet. But it will not parse.

html5 will parse the content and  it will be used by bs4 to give HTML content a tree like structure so that it can be transversed
