Sam ,Best. Go for it for listen to haters,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It is very good product in the price range. And it looks like apple Air pods. Very cool design and awesome product. The sound is good and build is strong. I say go for it better than any other.
Sunil Sharma,Average sound,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Average performance, could have had better bass, music is just so flat.Call quality is good and they function like apple earpod pro, minus the bass.Average buy at this price point."
Abhay,Good audio quality but uncomfortable design,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the bids today. Good audio quality and clear voice calls however not comfortable to wear for a long time.Cannot use the buds independently.Right bud is master and left one is slave.Case design is different, cannot keep it upright.Price after prime day is the same so not much of an advantage to order during prime day."

ashish malgawa,"Touch doesn't work, No Dual mics.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't know if at this price there are other good TWH. Hence, giving more than 1 star.Cons1. Touch Doesn't work properly (Like 95% of the time it won't work).2. The closing case is loose.3. There are no individual mics, I bought two pairs. None of them have individual mics in each piece. They're lying in the product description.4. The mic was picking up a lot of noise in an empty room when connected via a zoom call.Pros1. It's lightweight and has good enough sound so if you are buying these for long calls, then it's okay.2. Sort of comfortable.UPDATE:-The only time that touch works is to accidentaly cut the call. Just tell me how to disable this good for nothing touch or just enable replacement for your stupid product"
Ankur Dutta,Hit and Miss,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought it on prime day launch and got a defective piece which was replaced by Amazon. This one has good audio quality, decent range and battery lasted a good 3 hour music session yesterday and a 3 hour Audible session today without any battery warnings or promps so all good. However, mic quality is abysmal. Took multiple calls today, cellular and two webex dial-in, webex over wifi, all had complaints of bad audio quality from the people I was talking to, so it wasn't my cellular or wifi or mobile data, in all three instances, speech quality was bad enough for people to bring it up. A decent piece to listen to some music on the go and that's as far as I'd recommend this."
Chandra,Good but not great! Lot to catch up.. not good at the price point !,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Beware :if you have small ears DONT BUY! Second touch sensitivity is very bad and not consistent!Looks and design  : 4.5 very beautiful almost apple like.Setup: 5 . In minutes it can be setup on apple or android phones.Performance: 4 out of 5  in sound quality for music as well as  call. Very balanced with all notes .. don’t worry about 6 mm driver its beast when adjusted to ear canal properly.Comfort: 3 the size of the main hood is bigger .. smaller ears ( my case) it hurts.. little better after changing the tops to small.. snug fit after little adjustment but not anc but rather the ear feel stuffy( completely dependent who like in year or half in ear type) .Touch response:2-3 lot of improvements needed here . Inconsistent and laggy but once you come to know where to tap one can manage.. fits I thought it was faulty… but it was latency in response.

Suman,Just an average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Edit after using for 3 days.These are my first tws buds. Audio quality is okay (not too good or bad) and call quality is not good (Call quality is good on the first day but from 2nd day, callers are complaining about the voice clarity). 3 stars for Audio and 2.5 stars for call quality."
